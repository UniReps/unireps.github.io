	abstract = {We report the development of GPT-4, a large-scale, multimodal model which can accept image and text inputs and produce text outputs. While less capable than humans in many real-world scenarios, GPT-4 exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks, including passing a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10\% of test takers. GPT-4 is a Transformer-based model pre-trained to predict the next token in a document. The post-training alignment process results in improved performance on measures of factuality and adherence to desired behavior. A core component of this project was developing infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales. This allowed us to accurately predict some aspects of GPT-4's performance based on models trained with no more than 1/1,000th the compute of GPT-4.},

abstract = {Oncology navigation is defined as individualized assistance offered to patients, families, and caregivers to help overcome healthcare system barriers and facilitate timely access to quality health and psychosocial care from prediagnosis through all phases of the cancer experience. With the evolution of innovations in screening services, precision medicine in diagnostics, and advanced developments in cancer treatment, oncology patient navigation is a solution to this complexity as a health delivery support strategy that expands across the cancer care continuum to address fragmentation and assist in explaining the maze of information by enhancing patient shared decision making. Navigators are members of the oncology interdisciplinary team to help address oncology care fragmentation and promote delivery of a coordinated and seamless experience across the care continuum for patients. This personalized care strategy can be applied and impact all geographies where oncology care is provided and be a solution for the increasing health equity concerns among cancer patients. With ongoing evidence on positive patient experience, clinical outcomes and return on investment, navigation will continue to fit in with the quality value of future oncology as well as other chronic diseases.}
